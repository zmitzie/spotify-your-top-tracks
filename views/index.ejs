  <h3>See your most-listened to tracks/artists from Spotify</h3>
  <p>A quick nodeJS app that implements the Spotify Personalization API. By logging in with your Spotify account
    (through the Spotify Accounts Service), the app gets an access token for your account and displays the top 50
    most-listened tracks or artists in the past 6 months. We don't store the access token in a database, instead it is
    saved in the browser.</p>
  <p>You can also listen to a quick 30 second preview of the track. If you use a Chromium-based browser (like Google
    Chrome) you can easily download the 30s preview track and use it as a ringtone - but tell no one ðŸ¤«</p>
